# Folded

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) to create files under the current active folder. This is there just because Obsidian does not provide a quick keymap for this functionality.

# Configuration
Install the Folded plugin, and map the "Create File Under Currently Active Folder" to a key. On pressing the key, it should create new notes under the currently active folder.
